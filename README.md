# SpaceGame

In this game, players take on the role of a skilled pilot navigating through an asteroid field in outer space. The primary objective is to survive as long as possible by dodging incoming asteroids and shooting them down with missiles. Players control the plane's movements using the left and right arrow keys, allowing them to weave through the asteroid obstacles. The spacebar or another designated key can be used to launch missiles at the asteroids. Players earn points for each successfully destroyed asteroid.
